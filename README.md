<b>IT Tralee: Year 2 Semester 1</b>

The motivation of the proposed idea was to implement functionalities of a restaurant system, and showcase of the Java OOP Principles (Abstraction, Polymorphisms, Inheritance etc). The proposed design and implementation contains the following features:

* Staff Management, e.g. save and remove staffs.
* Cuisines Management, e.g. save and remove cuisines.
* Daily Sales Management, e.g. save and view daily sales.

Details of staff, cuisines, and sales are saved into .dat file and will be read from that file when system is invoked.

* Java - IntelliJ IDEA
* Microsoft Visio for UML Diagram
